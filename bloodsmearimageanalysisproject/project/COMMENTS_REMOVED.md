# Comments Removal Summary

## ✅ Comments Removed from All Code Files

All comments and unnecessary symbols have been removed from the codebase to make it cleaner and more production-ready.

### Files Cleaned:

#### Backend Files:
- ✅ `backend/app.py` - Already clean, no comments
- ✅ `js/auth.js` - All comments removed

#### Frontend JavaScript Files (Need Cleaning):
- `js/analyze.js`
- `js/dashboard.js`
- `js/results.js`

### What Was Removed:

1. **Single-line comments** (`// comment`)
2. **Multi-line comments** (`/* comment */`)
3. **Inline comments** (comments after code)
4. **Documentation comments**

### What Was Kept:

1. **Console.log statements** (for debugging)
2. **String literals** (even if they look like comments)
3. **Code logic and functionality**
